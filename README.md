# ReadMe
I worked through the previous version of the textbook and lecture series back in 2019 as part of my MS in Biostatistics. 
However, it has been several years since I have needed to use an Bayesian regression techniques, and as such, I felt it was 
time to refamiliarize myself with them. There are two new (to me) R packages for model estimation INLA and and BRMS. Based on
some small tests these seem superior to the rethinking package for daily work, equivalent to PyMC3. So, I will be working through
the new text book, homework problems, and interesting code examples from the book with the rethinking package, as well as BRMS and INLA.
